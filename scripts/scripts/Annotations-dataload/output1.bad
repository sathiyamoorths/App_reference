Once all the tasks are close in Clarify I will proceed further with the Closure process.  24/09 OM advised, Please note that we had the MSP NNI Testing on 08.09.2020 it was successfully completed. At the moment I?m still waiting for BTI engineer to close the AMDOCS task : 110.19 Integrate Service   28/08 OM advised,  Based on global circuit writing team confirmation - on this order we cannot add the VLAN  testing 301 due to the fact that the order was raised as MSP NNI and Cramer was modelled with 1G NNI bearer alone. If customer will need to configure VLAN/3c, a new service order must be raised. Also I?ve shared this feedback with Validation Order Desk team to confirm if we can have a new Testing order raised and associated with the current one. I?ve informed customer regarding this feedback received form our global circuit writing team   20/08 OM advised,, Based on the latest feedback received [form customer and the solution consultant] we need to complete the re build to configure a new VLAN for testing, The request is to add VLAN 301. Rebuild request was set on HOLD due to this reason : Cramer should be modelled to show the changes required. Currently Cramer doesn?t show a VLAN. Email sent to global circuit writing team to update Cramer and based on the feedback received from them - The subjected order is to provide NNI bearer and not 3C service. So, it is only bearer order and VLAN will not be shown in bearer order. If this need to be configured with VLAN and 3C, service order needs to be raised. Feedback shared with the Solution Consultant to assist further.   12/08 SA Laurence O'Meara advised, still the problem with the KDD equipment on the Frankfurt: they are now talking to SA covering the NNI about changing the set up. Even if they get that resolve we cant transfer the traffic from OLD NNI to new NNI. there is no know process to move the Services off old NNI to this NNI, This affects all NNI  CMPLS service. We are waiting for confirmation of the set up, and process   07/08 Laurence O'Merara advised there is a problem on the customer site meaning they are unable to use the NNI, also even when working , there is no know process to move the Services off old NNI to this NNI, This affects all NNI  CMPLS service. We are waiting for confirmation of the set up, and process  30/07 Awaiting soulution consultant and customer to resolve outstanding issues 13/07 OM advised, The issue persist. Last week the Solution consultant had a call with the customer and based on the Solution Consultant checks the filter policies we currently have on existing legacy NNIs and he found that on those we don?t have RT filter deployed but according to updated security policy we need to have it applied on the new NNI interfaces.  As a possible workaround as solution consultant suggested,  customer can try to disable sending extended communities on both test NNI interfaces, this should prevent sending extended community attributes to Vodafone ASBRs including RT community. Pending for customer confirmation.     03/06 Yes, the Solution designer replied to me and he advised that customer should delete RT communities when advertising their prefixes to VF. This can be done with Juniper routers. Waiting for customer to confirms.  29/06  Solution designer replied to OM and advised that customer should delete RT communities when advertising their prefixes to VF. This can be done with Juniper routers. (See details below for further info) Waiting for customer to confirms.    KDDI Europe Ltd we had the service activation which was failed (in February)  ?Both NNIs are configured the same except we have a different LP/MED configured on each NNI to make one primary (LP150, MED 50) and one backup (LP100, MED100). Apart from that, it?s the same. The issue we?re seeing is that we?re receiving a route-target community from you on Frankfurt but not on London. For security reasons our ASBR drops the prefix. Once the prefix is sent to us without the RT, our ASBR will accept it: Order manager advised I?ve followed up many times with customer to confirm us if they managed to delete the route ?target community from the prefix in order to finalize the activation with our BTI engineer, but this was their feedback :  ?After extensive troubleshooting with Juniper, they have advised us there is no way for us to send BGP info without community on the Secondary NNI for devices which are not directly connected to our router in Frankfurt. Due to this, we are unable to migrate any circuits to the new NNIs.  Please could you ask your engineers if there is any way around the BGP community security policy you have in place? At this time there is no way around it from our end. ?
